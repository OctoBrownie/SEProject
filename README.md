### Notes for Setup & Install:
This library has to be compiled and built with Qt. It also must use Cmake. So, using the Qt Framework, Qmake, and Cmake, this project can be built.

Then, in the build, move the "./config/settings.json" folder directly into the directory that the compiled build is stored in.
